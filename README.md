- 👋 Hi, I’m @schmeegs
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Java, Deep learning Neural networks, RPA & Project based learning from a coding perspective, outside of that I am mainly focused on PM roles. I decided not to persure a career in dev as I like to be involved in the business side too much.
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge in Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that get me closer to my vision becoming a great PO/PM with a strong technical but also business knowledge
