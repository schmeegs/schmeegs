- 👋 Hi, I’m @schmeegs also known as Will Murray and I'm passionate about product.
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Deep learning Neural networks, RPA & Project based learning from a coding perspective, outside of that I am mainly focused on PM/PO roles. I decided not to persure a career in dev as I like to be involved in the business side too much.
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge in Python with a vision to progress into implementing Deep Learning in a bunch of personal projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that get me closer to my vision becoming a great PO/PM with a strong technical but also marketing knowledge
- 📫 How to reach me william.murray1995@gmail.com
